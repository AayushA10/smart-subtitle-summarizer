Hi everyone, welcome back to the podcast.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:06,000
Today, we’re diving deep into the topic of productivity.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:09,000
Why do some people get more done in 24 hours than others?

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, it starts with understanding energy management.

5
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:15,000
We often mistake being busy with being productive.

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,000
Actually, multitasking can reduce efficiency.

7
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,000
So today, we'll break down how to prioritize tasks effectively.

8
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:24,000
We'll also talk about the myth of hustle culture.

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,000
You know, working non-stop doesn’t always lead to better results.

10
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:30,000
Sometimes, it leads to burnout, anxiety, and fatigue.

11
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:33,000
To help with this, we brought on productivity coach Emma Rivera.

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:36,000
She’s trained over 1,000 professionals in time management.

13
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,000
Emma, welcome to the show.

14
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,000
Thanks so much for having me, I'm excited to be here.

15
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,000
Let’s start with what productivity actually means.

16
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:48,000
Sure! Productivity is about maximizing meaningful output.

17
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
It’s not about doing more things, but doing the right things.

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,000
And making sure you have time for rest and reflection.

19
00:00:54,200 --> 00:00:57,000
That’s such a good reminder. I think we all need that.

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:00,000
Let’s dive into techniques like time-blocking and deep work.
